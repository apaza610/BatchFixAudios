# BatchFixAudios
Batch Fix audio levels from video tutorials (Audacity must be previously opened)<br>
It creates a file D:/temp.txt so that if Audacity crashes or you need to stop the process early it will keep track of not yet fixed MP4s<br>
If Audacity crashes you can close/reopen Audacity and this app<br>
If this app seems paused just press the "Batch Fix" button to resume operation<br>
The Bell sound will tell you when convertion is Over.
